### Why use coding in R to manage and analyze ecological data? {.build}
<br>

- Code is **reproducible**. This means you can share it with your collaborators, reviewers, and other researchers and they will be able to see exactly what you did.  

- Code is **easily revised**. If you need to change an early step in your analysis pathway, it is generally efficient to make the change and re-run the rest of your analyses.  

- R is **open-source**. It's free to use, and its associated programs are free to use, so this means that you won't have to buy programs to analyse your data.  

- R has an **excellent support community**. If you run into a problem, it's highly likely that someone has already figured out the solution and put it online.

### Sounds great! Let's get started.
<br>

But first we need data.
  
Example data source: Cameron EK, Cahill JF Jr, Bayne EM (2014) Root foraging influences plant growth responses to earthworm foraging. PLoS ONE 9(9): e108873.

The authors did a great job making their data tidy and accessible, but for learning purposes, I've messed it up a bit.

### What does tidy data look like? {.build}
<br>

- Each column contains one **variable** in a consistent format

- Each row contains one **observation**

- Each table/file contains one data set

- Column names are succinct and intuitive and have descriptive metadata associated with them

- "Note" fields are useful and informative

- Data has been checked for typos and outliers

### Tidy data exercise
<br>

- Form groups of 2-3
- Open roots-messy.xls in a spreadsheet program
- I'll assign you a section to work on
- Tidy up your section and save it as a .csv file

### Datasheet design and data entry
<br>

- Datasheet design and data entry are best done in Excel, Google sheets, or a similar program.

- Datasheets should always contain a header with room for the date, the location, the experiment, and the names of the observers.

- Datasheets should be arranged intuitively to facilitate efficiency and minimize recording errors.

- Whenever appropriate, randomize your observations or experimental units. You can use random number generators for this.
